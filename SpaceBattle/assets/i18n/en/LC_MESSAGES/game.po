"Spacehip's main mission is detection of singularities\n"
"that prevent good communication with Space Flight Control Center.\n"
"The tool that makes that detection possible is high precision scanner "
"(HPS).\n"

"In 0.5 parsecs from HPS refueling point you were called on the\n"
"bridge due to emergency. Spacehip's sensors detected some abnormal\n"

"The Captain ordered to perform low energy scanning on the sector F.\n"
"Scanners detected 3 battleships nearby. Two 3-masted battleships and one\n"
"5-masted command ship. But due to the fact that scanning was performed in\n"
"low energy mode you were not able to detect precise location of "
"battleships.\n"
"\n"
"You were ordered to detect precise location of the battleships to find\n"
"a safe route through sector F using HPS.\n"
"\n"
"Due to the fact that you almost used all charges of the HPS in sector\n"
"E you have only 20 charges left.\n"

"HPS emits a beam that allows to get precise information\n"
"of the area nearby the target point.\n"
"Coordinates of the target point must be entered precisely in following "
"order: X Y Z.\n"

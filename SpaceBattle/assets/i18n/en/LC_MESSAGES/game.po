"You are the Chief HPS Engineer on the research spaceship. Your ship is on "
"course to HPS refuelling point. Spaceship's main mission is detection of "
"singularities that prevent good communication with Space Flight Control "
"Centre. The tool that makes that detection possible is high precision "
"scanner (HPS). \n"
"\n"
"In 0.5 parsecs from HPS refuelling point you were called on the bridge due "
"to emergency. Spaceship's sensors detected some abnormal radiation in "
"sector F. \n"
"\n"
"The Captain ordered to perform low energy scanning on the sector F. "
"Scanners detected 3 battleships nearby. Two 3-masted battleships and one 5-"
"masted command ship. But since scanning was performed in low energy mode "
"you were not able to detect precise location of battleships. \n"
"\n"
"You were ordered to detect precise location of the battleships to find a "
"safe route through sector F using HPS. \n"
"Because you almost used all charges of the HPS in sector E you have only "
"20 charges left. \n"
"\n"
"HPS emits a beam that allows to get precise information of the area nearby "
"the target point. Coordinates of the target point must be entered "
"precisely in following order: X Y Z. The coordinates must be separated by "
"space and after entering the coordinates they must be committed with "
"commit button (Enter). \n"
"\n"
"Here is the picture that low energy scanning was able to get. All scanners "
"on the spaceship capture 3D image using right-handed Cartesian coordinate "
"system and report it using two projections of the 3D image: top and front "
"projections."
